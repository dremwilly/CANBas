# CANBas
a simple Basic Interpreter for Windows (Console)  for the PEAK-System CAN Adapters (PCAN-USB, PCAN-PCIe etc.)
Based on the C-Interpreter from H.Schildt
The program was originally published in Dr. Dobb's Journal in August, 1989 entitled "Building your own C interpreter"

New features: 
change syntax to run Basic Keywords, use console features like goto xy, set color etc.
add Remarks, add CAN Handling, use Windows Messages, add Wait and RND numbers, 
use a Staus Line etc.

This is Software is at is. Use it or change it for your need...
I will not do any support - debug it and optimize it
